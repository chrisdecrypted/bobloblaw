# Bob Loblaw's Law Blog

Turned a silly quoteable from Arrested Development (TV Series) into a basic WordPress demo. 

It's pretty basic, but there is a little more than meets the eye: 

+ Created Compute Instance with Ubuntu Minimallist image
+ Installed necessary PHP, Apache, and MariaDB files
+ Created WordPress database
+ Configured host
+ Pointed instance IP to http://wordpress.christopher-murray.com subdomain
